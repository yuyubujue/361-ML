In this article, we aim to analyze the verification of data-aware process models in the context of simultaneous multi-round auctions. Our motivation is to better understand the relationships between revenue, verification results, and verification time, as well as to predict these variables based on other features of the auction and verification procedure. By doing so, we hope to improve the efficiency of the modeling and verification process, thereby optimizing auction designs and outcomes.
  
In this study, revenue and verification time are continuous variables, while the verification result is a categorical variableWe use subsets of the data for validation purposes.We can utilize the Random Forest algorithm, which is capable of addressing both classification and regression problems. This algorithm can also handle the nonlinear dependencies present in the raw data effectively. Considering the sample size and our research objectives, cross-validation can also be applied. 10-fold cross-validation can help us reduce the risk of overfitting associated with the Random Forest algorithm.
