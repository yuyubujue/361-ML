A couple of sentences of how this is related to ML for Scientific Discovery
	  Our team chose the dataset of auction to test and optimize the machine learning. As the auction is quite time-consuming, we hope to find out if there is an effective algorithm to simplify the process of the auction and even can predict the result. Due to the large amount of data, we believe machine learning is the best way to achieve this goal.
